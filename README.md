## Article 2 - Government Mechanisms - [Taken from CFN Const, revised mildly]

I. By decree of this constitution, it is therefore established that a
government of the people shall exist, which is to be organised in a
Parliamentary system.\
II. The Majority Time Vote is to be utilised at the Cabinet level, and
as such may be implemented by relevant government officials whenever
necessary. It will involve a 48 hour voting period during which time
individuals will submit their vote regarding a proposal. At the end of
the period, plurality will dictate the outcome of the vote (most number
of votes wins, regardless of majority).\
III. The Shortened Time Vote is to be utilised at the Cabinet level, and
as such may be implemented by relevant government officials whenever
necessary. It will involve a 24 hour voting period during which time
individuals will submit their vote regarding a proposal. At the end of
the period, plurality will dictate the outcome of the vote.\
IV. The Executive Veto is to be given to the Chancellor. An
unsatisfactory bill may be vetoed directly by this individual. However,
should the Cabinet arrive at a clear supermajority vote of 4/6, then the
veto shall be overruled. This overruled veto cannot be reinstated under
any circumstances.\
V. The Referendum is a public vote for all registered citizens to be
able to partake in. Referenda shall have a simple two options of yes and
no, be open for a minimum of 5 days, and may only be called for by a
group of 7 citizens, a Cabinet supermajority, or the Chancellor. If the
referendum passes with approval ratings above 60%, then the decision
must be carried out. If the referendum is between 50-60%, the Cabinet
will be called for a Majority Time Vote where the decision may be vetoed
by the Chancellor.
