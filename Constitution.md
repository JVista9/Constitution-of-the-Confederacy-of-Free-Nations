## Article 2 - Government Mechanisms - [Taken from CFN Const, revised mildly]

**I**. By decree of this constitution, it is therefore established that a
government of the people shall exist, which is to be organised in a
Parliamentary system.\
**II**. The Majority Time Vote is to be utilised at the Cabinet level, and
as such may be implemented by relevant government officials whenever
necessary. It will involve a 48 hour voting period during which time
individuals will submit their vote regarding a proposal. At the end of
the period, plurality will dictate the outcome of the vote (most number
of votes wins, regardless of majority).\
**III**. The Shortened Time Vote is to be utilised at the Cabinet level, and
as such may be implemented by relevant government officials whenever
necessary. It will involve a 24 hour voting period during which time
individuals will submit their vote regarding a proposal. At the end of
the period, plurality will dictate the outcome of the vote.\
**IV**. The Executive Veto is to be given to the Chancellor. An
unsatisfactory bill may be vetoed directly by this individual. However,
should the Cabinet arrive at a clear supermajority vote of 4/6, then the
veto shall be overruled. This overruled veto cannot be reinstated under
any circumstances.\
**V**. The Referendum is a public vote for all registered citizens to be
able to partake in. Referenda shall have a simple two options of yes and
no, be open for a minimum of 5 days, and may only be called for by a
group of 7 citizens, a Cabinet supermajority, or the Chancellor. If the
referendum passes with approval ratings above 60%, then the decision
must be carried out. If the referendum is between 50-60%, the Cabinet
will be called for a Majority Time Vote where the decision may be vetoed
by the Chancellor.

## Article 3 - The Confederate Parliament - [Taken from CFN Const, revised heavily]
--------------------------------------
**I**. A Member of Parliament, to be known as an MP, is an individual responsible for generating proposals and representing the general public within the Confederacy. To qualify for the role of MP, one must apply for citizenship with the Minister of Internal Affairs, have a listed WA nation, and be accepted into the citizenry.\
**II**. The Speaker is established as the leader of the Parliament. Their role is to maintain order and organisation within Parliament as well as preserving Parliamentary authority. The Speaker is tasked with organising voting in regard to legislation and other matters as Parlimanent as well as archiving and storing laws and failed legislation. The Speaker is elected every 2 months in a standard election.\
**III**. The Parliament's primary purpose is to be a forum of legislation for the Confederacy. Any MP may submit proposals and vote on other proposals. Legislation is passed through the Parliament into law if after a one-week period that legislation holds an 80% or above supermajority endorsement rating. If the endorsement rating is between 50-80%, then the Cabinet will be called for a Majority Time Vote concerning the legislation at hand. If the legislation does not reach a 50% or above endorsement rating, then it is shot down from the Parliament.\
**IV**. The Parliament's check on the power of the Cabinet lies in its ability to remove Cabinet members. Such a decision will require that the legislature pertaining to the removal of the Minister(s) be on the floor for one-week, and at the one-week mark the legislature hold a 70% or above endorsement rating with 10 or more MPs voting in said legislature. Any Minister in the process of undergoing impeachment shall not be allowed to vote within the legislature on matters pertaining to his or her impeachment.\
**V**. In addition, an unjust vote by the Cabinet can be called out through formal complaint. During this time, it is necessary for 5 individuals to submit a formal proposal and complaint to the Speaker, who will review its validity and determine if a general vote is in order. If it is, then the entire Parliament will vote on the proposed law, including the Cabinet.\
**VI**. There is to be no limit on the number of MPs or pieces of legislature on the floor at one time.\
**VII**. Unless specified in the body of a bill, no law passed by Parliament is retroactive. An act committed may only be punished according to the provisons of a law that was fully in force at the time the act was committed.\
**VIII** Unless specified in the body of a bill, individual may be held accountable to a law even if its provisions expired or were repealed so long as the act can be proven to have been committed during a time when the law was in force.\
